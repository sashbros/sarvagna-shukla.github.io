## Want to use it ?

Sure, just `fork` this repository. 

`clone` it on your local machine.

Make changes as you wish. `commit` and `push` the changes. 

Deploy it on GH pages.


### Don't know how to code ?

No worries. I got you.

Make your changes to the content in `objects.js`

Add your own content and images ( make sure to add the images in `/img` directory ) 

### Want to see your changes locally as you make it ?

Open your terminal. Make sure you're in the root directory.

Make sure you've `node` installed. Check by executing `node -v` and `npm -v` on your command line.

If not, check this out. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Execute: 
```bash
npm i
```
This will install all the dependencies from `package-lock.json`. 

Although `npm i vite` would do the job, doing this won't blast your system. 

Run command:
```bash
npx vite
```

This will start a server on `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` or `http://localhost:5173/`

Save after you make changes, and the server would refresh automatically.

## Want to make this repository ***butter*** ?

I know this code is a little... umm, let's say '**rustic**', but hey, you can contribute your magic touch and make it as *smooth* as *butter*.

Contribute by making a `pull request`. 

If I'm alive, I'll check it out and merge it into the `master` branch.
